  Drone Project

Welcome to the **Drone Project**! This repository contains code and documentation for a multifunctional drone that combines innovative features to provide an engaging and practical experience in automation and robotics.

 Features  

1. **Mapping**  
- Create and visualize maps of the drone's surroundings.  
- Useful for navigation and path planning.  

2. **Basic Movements**  
- Control the drone's basic movements: take off, land, hover, ascend, descend, and more.  

3. **Color Picker**  
- Detect and track specific colors using real-time video feeds.  
- Applicable for object recognition and sorting tasks.  

4. **Face Tracking**  
- Automatically detect and follow faces using onboard camera feeds.  
- Ideal for personal tracking or interactive applications.  

5. **Image Capture**  
- Capture high-resolution images from the drone's camera.  
- Save images locally for further analysis or sharing.  

6. **Keypress Module**  
- Control the drone via keyboard inputs using a custom keypress module.  

7. **Keyboard Control**  
- Intuitive keyboard-based manual control for navigation and feature activation.  

8. **Line Following**  
- Enable autonomous movement by following pre-defined lines.  
- Great for industrial or guided tasks.  

9. **Surveillance**  
- Use the drone for monitoring and surveillance, streaming live video feeds.  
- Enhances security and remote observation capabilities.
